# The Language-Lab Flash Card Application


Hey there!
I created this application, where you can test your skills of learning languages of your choice, where you can also create DECKS of language you want and respectively add cards to them as well.
Any contributions to enhance the functionality of the app are welcome.

To run the application: 
-> cd final-project
-> chmod 777 start.sh
-> ./start.sh
